I"∆<p>If you‚Äôve been holding out for <em>World of Warcraft: Legion</em>, let me say this:</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt.</p>

<p>I had a chance to play the beta, where I copied over all of my current live characters
and progressed them all to the mid 100s and the leveling experience is miles ahead of <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, and I thought that expansion had a fantastic leveling experience, you just slammed headfirst into a wall of ‚Äúnothing to do.‚Äù</p>

<p>Blizzard is also talking a good game about learning from their mistakes with <em>Draenor</em>, namely too few content patches, and some amount of hubris with their timeline for <em>Legion</em> (likely they already have storyboards and are starting the framework for whatever expansion will follow this one)</p>

<p>The pre-expansion content went live this past Tuesday, and it‚Äôs exceedingly well done.  Nothing feels better than flying from a city to a location being invaded by the Burning Legion and seeing a couple dozen other players around you, all headed for one objective.  I hope that the zone events continue into the expansion, so we have the feeling of a vibrant, active world, rather than having people stay in cities until their dungeon queue pops.</p>
