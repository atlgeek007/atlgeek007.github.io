If you've been holding out for *World of Warcraft: Legion*, let me say this:

Don't.

I had a chance to play the beta, where I copied over all of my current live characters
and progressed them all to the mid 100s and the leveling experience is miles ahead of *Warlords of Draenor*, and I thought that expansion had a fantastic leveling experience, you just slammed headfirst into a wall of "nothing to do."

Blizzard is also talking a good game about learning from their mistakes with *Draenor*, namely too few content patches, and some amount of hubris with their timeline for *Legion* (likely they already have storyboards and are starting the framework for whatever expansion will follow this one)

The pre-expansion content went live this past Tuesday, and it's exceedingly well done.  Nothing feels better than flying from a city to a location being invaded by the Burning Legion and seeing a couple dozen other players around you, all headed for one objective.  I hope that the zone events continue into the expansion, so we have the feeling of a vibrant, active world, rather than having people stay in cities until their dungeon queue pops.
