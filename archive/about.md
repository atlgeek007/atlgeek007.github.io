**Chris McCoy** is a Linux Sysadmin/DevOps type guy from Atlanta, GA USA.  He currently works for a "big four" company in Kennesaw, GA doing Linux and AWS administration.

His hobbies include games (both board and video), movies, playing around with his overcomplicated homelab (a post on that will be forthcoming)
